Linux is a kernel-based operating system which enables users to customize it and provides open-source code for modifications.

## Interfaces

### CLI (Command Line Interface)
<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9f/Gnome-terminal.png" width="300"/>

It is similar to PowerShell. You can write commands that the kernel executes.

### Kernel
<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3f/Linux_kernel_map.png" width="300"/>

The core of the operating system. It virtualizes hardware such as CPU, hard disk, and allocated memory. It provides virtual resources and prevents conflicts between processes.

### GUI (Graphical User Interface)
<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5e/GNOME_Shell.png" width="300"/>

A way to interact with the computer through graphical elements.

## File System Hierarchy

<img src="Img\hFILE.png" width="700"/>

**/**  
The top-level directory (root filesystem). It contains all files required to boot the operating system. After boot, other filesystems are mounted as subdirectories of `/`.

**/etc**  
Local system configuration files. Configuration files for installed applications may also be stored here.

**/home**  
Each user on the system has a subdirectory here for storage.

**/media**  
External removable media devices such as USB drives are mounted here.

## Linux Philosophy

<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8f/Linux_system_components.png" width="300"/>

The Linux philosophy centers on simplicity, modularity, and openness. It promotes small, single-purpose programs that can be combined to perform complex tasks.

| Principle | Description |
|---------|------------|
| Everything is a file | Configuration files are stored as text files |
| Small, single-purpose programs | Tools are designed to do one task well |
| Ability to chain programs | Tools can be combined to perform complex tasks |
| Avoid captive user interfaces | Linux focuses on shell usage |
| Configuration stored in text files | Example: `/etc/passwd` |

## Components

<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8f/Linux_system_components.png" width="300"/>

| Component | Description |
|---------|------------|
| Bootloader | Guides the boot process (e.g., GRUB) |
| OS Kernel | Manages hardware resources |
| Daemons | Background services |
| OS Shell | Interface between user and OS |
| Graphics server | Provides graphical subsystem (X Server) |
| Window Manager | Graphical user interface |
| Utilities | Programs that perform specific functions |

## Linux Architecture

<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0c/Linux_architecture.png" width="350"/>

| Layer | Description |
|------|------------|
| Hardware | CPU, RAM, disk, peripherals |
| Kernel | Controls and virtualizes hardware |
| Shell | Command-line interface |
| System Utility | Provides OS functionality |

Each Linux distribution is different, with its own features, packages, and tools.
