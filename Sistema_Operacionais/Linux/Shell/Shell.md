## SHELL
- It provides a text-based **input/output (I/O) interface** between users and the kernel for a computer system.



## SHELL EMULATORS
- Terminal Emulators
Terminal emulation is software that emulates the function of a terminal. It allows the use of text-based programs within a graphical user interface (GUI). There are also so-called command-line interfaces (CLI) that run as additional terminals in one terminal. In short, a terminal serves as an interface to the shell interpreter.

- Imagine you're in a large office building where the shell is the main server room that processes all the company's data and commands. The terminal is like a receptionist's desk that serves as a point of communication to the server room. You go to the receptionist (terminal) to deliver instructions or requests to the server room (shell).

- Now, suppose you're working remotely. Terminal emulation software acts like a virtual receptionist's desk on your computer screen (the GUI), allowing you to interact with the server room without being physically present in the office. It emulates the function of the actual receptionist's desk, enabling you to use text-based programs and commands within a graphical environment.

-Terminal emulators and multiplexers are beneficial extensions for the terminal. They provide us with different methods and functions to work with the terminal, such as splitting the terminal into one window, working in multiple directories, creating different workspaces, and much more

## Other Shells

 - The most commonly used shell in Linux is the Bourne-Again Shell **(BASH)**, and is part of the GNU project. Everything we do through the GUI we can do with the shell. The shell gives us many more possibilities to interact with programs and processes to get information faster. Besides, many processes can be easily automated with smaller or larger scripts that make manual work much easier.
